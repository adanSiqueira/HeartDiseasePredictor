This project presents a dynamic and interactive web application for predicting the risk of heart disease based on clinical data. The model and dashboard are built upon a well-known dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease), derived from angiographic results of 303 patients at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio.

## üîç Project Overview

This application is divided into two main pages:

### 1. **Heart Disease Prediction**

A form-based interface allows users to input patient information such as:
- Age, Sex
- Blood pressure and cholesterol levels
- Fasting blood sugar
- Electrocardiogram results
- Maximum heart rate
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression, among others

Once submitted, these values are passed to a machine learning model trained using **XGBoost**, which classifies whether the patient is at risk of having heart disease.

### 2. **Graphic Analysis**

This page provides multiple interactive visualizations using **Plotly**, enabling users to explore trends and patterns from the dataset, such as:
- Heart disease distribution by age and sex
- Relationship between cholesterol or blood pressure and heart disease
- Blood sugar and ECG pattern analysis

These charts offer valuable insights into the clinical features correlated with heart conditions.

## üöÄ Why This Project Matters

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. A predictive tool like this can help medical professionals, students, and data enthusiasts identify risk patterns more quickly and efficiently. By combining explainable machine learning with a user-friendly interface, this project demonstrates the power of applied AI in healthcare diagnostics and education.
